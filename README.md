# llama4-from-scratch


This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) architecture from scratch, with clear explanations and modular code. The goal is to help researchers and engineers understand the inner workings of transformer-based language models by building one from the ground up.

## What is LLaMA?

[LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) is a family of transformer-based language models developed by Meta AI. It is designed for efficiency, scalability, and strong performance in generating and understanding natural language. LLaMA models have powered breakthroughs in AI research and practical applications such as chatbots and code assistants.

## Features

- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only uses essential libraries such as PyTorch and NumPy.
- **Modular Structure:** Each component (tokenizer, attention, feed-forward, etc.) is implemented in a separate file for clarity.
- **Educational Documentation:** Inline comments and markdown files explain the theory and implementation details.
- **Train & Evaluate:** Scripts provided for training the model on sample data and evaluating its performance.

##Disclaimer
-The feedforward, training, and evaluation scripts are still under development. Additionally, 'attention.py, tokenizer.py', and other related scripts have not yet been synchronized, so functionality may be incomplete or unstable.
